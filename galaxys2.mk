# This file is the device-specific product definition file for
# crespo. It lists all the overlays, files, modules and properties
# that are specific to this hardware: i.e. those are device-specific
# drivers, configuration files, settings, etc...

# Note that crespo is not a fully open device. Some of the drivers
# aren't publicly available in all circumstances, which means that some
# of the hardware capabilities aren't present in builds where those
# drivers aren't available. Such cases are handled by having this file
# separated into two halves: this half here contains the parts that
# are available to everyone, while another half in the vendor/ hierarchy
# augments that set with the parts that are only relevant when all the
# associated drivers are available. Aspects that are irrelevant but
# harmless in no-driver builds should be kept here for simplicity and
# transparency. There are two variants of the half that deals with
# the unavailable drivers: one is directly checked into the unreleased
# vendor tree and is used by engineers who have access to it. The other
# is generated by setup-makefile.sh in the same directory as this files,
# and is used by people who have access to binary versions of the drivers
# but not to the original vendor tree. Be sure to update both.
